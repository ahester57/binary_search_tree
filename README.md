This program takes in the name of a file ending with ```.sp18```. This file
should contain text.  

It then puts the strings in a binary search tree, indexed by string length.
A node contains all strings of its length value. Duplicate strings are
ignored.

It then prints pre-, in-, post-order traversals to the base file name with
.preorder, .inorder, & .postorder appended respectively.
